Shamaz

Project 3 for OpenClassrooms iOS Developer Path

Scenario

You are planning a party in your new spacious backyard and inviting a bunch of friends you haven’t seen in a long time. The food and drinks are taken care of, while the weather is promising to be delightful. Your only concern is about the entertainment. You want people to have fun, and, secretly, you want to show off your new skills in iOS app development and demonstrate how easy it is to start creating some cool stuff!
As you can guess, you’ve decided to create a fun party app! The event is in 2 days, so you've got to come up with something simple. Hmm...It would be nice to learn what your friends have been up to and their ideas and plans for the future, wouldn't it? 
There's our idea: an app that prompts each guest to tell a story, either by sharing an experience from the past or by talking about future plans. Let's call it the "Shamaz" app!

Requirements 

Each player can choose whether they want to share an experience from the past or an idea/plan for the future.
The app will then generate a story prompt for the player to use. Some example story prompts could be: "Describe your day 2 days ago" Or "What would you like to be doing a month from now?". Phrases will either use the past or the future and include a time indicator (like "2 weeks ago" or "next year"). 
Once players have chosen a prompt (and told their story), they can reset the activity and verbally nominate the next person to play OR you can make the app even fancier by completing the bonus-challenge below!
A player must select the "Future" or the "Past" option before they receive a prompt. 

Bonus-challenge: Add an option for the app to nominate the next player by generating a number from 1 to 10. In this case, the players would form a circle and starting from the active player, count off to identify the nominated person.
